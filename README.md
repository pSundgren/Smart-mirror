# Smart mirror
When first learning about HTML, JavaScript and APIs I decided to make the program to be hosted on a Raspberry PI that would be used on a smart mirror in my apartment. The project worked and the program programmed to fetch data based on my location back then. Is uses weather information, news, and local trafic information.
